### Objective
Identifing **surface-expressed (surfaceome/secretome) genes** in the complete genomes of *Staphylococcus epidermidis*.  
This analysis integrates **annotation-based**, **sequence-based**, and **experimental (MS-based, published)** approaches to comprehensively detect surface proteins.

### Results

#### 1. Annotation-based approach
- Added **GO annotation filtering** using the Gene Ontology term **GO:0005618** (*cell wall* / *cell surface*)  
- Genes annotated with this GO term were classified as surface-associated proteins.  
- Few proteins were classified by this approach.

#### 2. Sequence-based approach
Surface protein prediction was additionally performed using multiple computational tools:
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **TMHMM** | Predicts transmembrane helices to identify membrane-associated proteins |
| **Phobius** | Predicts both transmembrane regions and signal peptides |
| **SignalP**, **GPApred**, and **DeepLocPro**  | from previous step |

#### 3. Experimental validation reference
Surfaceome data from a **mass spectrometry (MS)**-based study were used for comparative validation:
> Karlsson, Anders, *et al.* (2024).  
> *Surface-Shaving of Staphylococcus aureus Strains and Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveal Differences in Protein Abundance of the Surfaceome.*  
> *Microorganisms*, **12**(8): 1725.  
> [https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12081725](https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12081725)

All *S. aureus* Newman strain surface proteins identified in this study were imported and compared to  
*S. epidermidis* ATCC14990 proteins using **BLAST**:
- **Query:** *S. epidermidis* ATCC14990 proteins  
- **Subject:** *S. aureus* Newman surface proteins
- **Threshold:** Percent identity > 85% and e-value < 1e-10 : 100 proteins
- Seems not specific.

### To do next
A **categorical chi-squared (χ²) test** will be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of each prediction method  
in identifying surface proteins.  
This statistical comparison helps determine which computational tool aligns most closely  
with experimentally validated surface proteins.
