### Report Information

### Objective
Identifying **surface-expressed genes** in *S. epidermidis* ATCC14990  

**How:** **curated surface gene sets**, **SignalP cleavage site predictions**, and **DeepLocPro (DLP) predictions**.  
The aim is to define a high-confidence subset of surface proteins.

### Methods

1. **Curated surface gene set**
   - Collected experimentally reported genes known to be expressed on the surface of _Staphylococcus_  
   - Total curated surface genes: **21**  

2. **BLAST comparison**
   - Compared the curated surface gene set to the full ATCC14990 proteome using BLAST  
   - **E-value cutoff:** 1e-5
   - Number of proteins hit in ATCC14990: **14**  

3. **SignalP cleavage site filtering**
   - Most curated genes have a **SignalP cleavage site between positions 29–53**  
   - Candidate surface proteins were selected if their SignalP cut site falls in this range  

4. **DeepLocPro (DLP) prediction**
   - Predictions with **Cellwall_surface localization** were considered high-specificity candidates  

5. **Selection criteria for high-confidence surface genes**
   - Proteins satisfying **either** of the following conditions were included:  
     - SignalP cleavage site between 29–53  
     - DeepLocPro prediction = Cellwall_surface

### Result
- The overlap between **curated surface genes**, **SignalP-based predictions**, and **DLP Cellwall_surface predictions**  
  was visualized using a **Venn diagram**.
