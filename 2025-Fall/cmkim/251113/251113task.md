## Topic: Prediction of Surface Proteins in *Staphylococcus epidermidis*

### Objective
Predict **surface-expressed proteins** using a **scoring system**  

---

### Methods

#### 1. Tools used
- **Signal peptide prediction:** Dectect signal peptide (SP / LIPO / OTHER / PILIN)  
- **CWpred:** Detect LPXTG-like motifs (Transmembrane / Globular / Cell-wall binding protein)  
- **TMHMM:** PredHel=n (number of transmembrane helices)  
- **DeepLocPro:** Predict location of protein (Cytoplasmic Membrane / Cytoplasmic / Extracellular / Cellwall_Surface)  
- **Pfam domain evidence:** PF00746 (Gram Pos anchor), PF01476 (LysM), PF05738(Ig-like domain), PF13457(fibrinogen-like domain), etc.

#### 2. Scoring system overview
- Total score = 100  
- Each category assigned a maximum weight; scores normalized if data is missing (pfam).  
- Higher scores indicate stronger evidence for surface localization.  

| Category | Max score | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Signal peptide (SP/LIPO/PILIN/OTHER) | 20 | LIPO = 20, SP = 16, PILIN = 14, OTHER = 0 |
| CWpred | 15 | Cell-wall binding = 15, Globular = 6, Transmembrane = 3 |
| TMHMM (PredHel) | 15 | 0 TM = 15, 1 TM N-term = 12, 1 TM elsewhere = 6, ≥2 TM = 0 |
| DeepLocPro | 20 | Cellwall_Surface = 20, Extracellular = 16, Cytoplasmic Membrane = 8, Cytoplasmic = 0 |
| Pfam domains | 30 | PF00746 = 12, PF01476 = 6, PF05738 = 6, PF13457 = 3 each, capped at 30 |

> **Handling missing data:** If a category is missing, its weight is excluded and remaining categories are normalized to maintain total score = 100.

### Results

- **Score thresholds:**  
  - Score ≥ 30 → 210 proteins (strict)  
  - Score ≥ 21 → 752 proteins (lenient)  

- **Score distribution images**

- **Top20 genes**

- **Hypothetical proteins:**  
  - 5 of top20 are **hypothetical proteins**  
  - Protein BLAST and domain analysis yield no significant hits  
  - AlphaFold structural prediction low confidence (pTM < 0.6)  
  - Likely represents uncharacterized genes
