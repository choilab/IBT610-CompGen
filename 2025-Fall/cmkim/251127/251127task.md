## Topic: Gene Clustering and Surface Protein Analysis in *Staphylococcus epidermidis*

### Objective
The goal of this analysis was to perform **gene clustering** across multiple *S. epidermidis* genomes  
and analyze representative sequences for potential surface proteins using CWpred, SignalP, and TMHMM.

### Reults

1. **Gene clustering**
   - Clustering tool: **MMseqs2**  
   - Number of genomes analyzed: **237**  
   - Total number of genes: **550,864**  
   - Parameters: sequence identity = 0.99, coverage = 1.0  
   - Number of **clustered gene representatives** obtained: **24,275**

3. **Cluster categorization**
   | Category | Definition | Counts |
   |----------|-----------|-----------|
   | Core | Present in > 95% of genomes | 673 |
   | Accessory | Present in 15–95% of genomes | 3,085 |
   | Rare | Present in < 15% of genomes | 20,517 |

4. **Representative sequence analysis**
   - Representative sequences from each gene cluster were analyzed using:  
     - **CWpred**: Cell-wall binding / Globular / Transmembrane prediction  
     - **SignalP**: Signal peptide prediction  
     - **TMHMM**: Number and position of transmembrane helices  

5. **Comparison (with CWpred result)**
   - CWpred predictions were compared with clustering results to identify the distribution of predicted surface proteins across **core, accessory, and rare genes**.

   - A **chi-square test of independence** was conducted to assess whether CWpred prediction types  
   (Cell-wall binding protein / Globular protein / Transmembrane protein) are associated with cluster category.

   - **Chi-square statistic:** 63.62
   - **Degrees of freedom:** 4
   - **P-value:** 5.02 × 10⁻¹³
  

     
  - To see which groups which groups drive significance, observed and expected values were standardized.
     - standard residuals = (observed - expected) / (expected)

     - Residuals > +2 → more observed than expected (over-representation)
     - Residuals < −2 → fewer observed than expected (under-representation)

- **Standardized residuals** highlight that **Cell-wall binding gene clusters are enriched for rare genes**, which may reflect strain-specific adaptations.
