# 🧬 2025-Fall Compuational Genomics Project
**Project Period:** 10/16/2025 ~ 12/18/2025

**Model Organism:** *Staphylococcus epidermidis*

**Researcher:** KIHYUN NAM

---

# Introduction
## Main Goal
This project uses *Staphylococcus epidermidis* a common skin commensal that can act as an opportunistic pathogen as a model organism to build a standardized analysis pipeline.

The pipeline covers the entire workflow, from constructing a clean, high-quality genomic dataset to functional profiling and data visualization.

## Detailed
### 1. Construction of a Clean Dataset
*  **QC(Quality Control) & Dereplication:** Apply **CheckM** and **FastANI** to filter out low-quality and redundant genomes.
*  **Bias Reduction:** Build a representative genome set to minimize bias and improve statistical reliability.
