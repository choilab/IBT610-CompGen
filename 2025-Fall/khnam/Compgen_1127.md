# Auxotrophy Analysis of *S. epidermidis*

##  Methods
* **Data Source:** Pan-genome results from 124 strains generated by Roary.
* **Pathway Reference:** GapMind (Reference Strain: PM221) and KEGG Pathway Database.
* **Screening Strategy:**
  **GapMind Validation:** By analyzing the presence/absence of every enzymatic step across the 124 strains, it was identified specific gene deletions (e.g., *ilvH*, *hisE*, *tyrB*) that act as critical pathway bottlenecks. This approach allowed for the precise determination of auxotrophic phenotypes by distinguishing between complete pathway loss and specific subunit deficiencies.

 ##  Results
 ### Amino Acid Biosynthesis Profile (Summary)
 The analysis of metabolic capabilities across 124 strains revealed three distinct categories based on pathway conservation:

| Category | Amino Acids | Phenotype | Key Mechanism / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conserved** | **Glu**, **Gln**, **Ala**, **Gly**, **Pro**, **Lys**, **Met**, **Thr**, **Cys** | ✅ **Prototroph**| Pathways linked to Central Metabolism are 100% conserved. |
| **Variable** | **Arg**, **Leu**, **Trp** |  ⚠️ **Variable**  | Strain-dependent presence/absence indicating ongoing evolutionary divergence. |
| **Auxotroph** | **Val**, **Ile**, **His**, **Phe**, **Tyr**, **Ser**, **Asn** |  🔴 **Auxotroph**  | Essential genes (*ilvH*, *hisE*, *tyrB*) are deleted across the entire population. |

# Antimicrobial Resistance and Virulence Profiling of 124 *S. epidermidis* Strains

## Methods
* **Tool:** NCBI AMRFinderPlus v4.0.19 (Database version: 2025-07-16.1).
* **Options:** The `--plus` flag was employed to identify not only resistance genes but also stress response and virulence factors.
* **Criteria:** Only genes passing stringent sequence identity and coverage thresholds were selected for the final profile.

## Results
